 My research focuses on international environmental politics. How do countries' adaptive responses to climate change affect their relationships with one another? Will new strategies to mask or cope with the effects of climate change disincentivize investments in long-term mitigation? What normative criteria do individuals use to decide who should bear the costs of mitigating the effects of climate change? I rely on formal models, experiments, and panel methods to try to answer these questions.

Previously, I worked at [IFF](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aseemmahajan?trk=nav_responsive_tab_profile), a Community Development Financial Institution in Chicago; and at PricewaterhouseCoopers' Global Transfer Pricing division in New York. I graduated from Princeton University in 2009 where I concentrated in politics and earned certificates in finance and political economy.
