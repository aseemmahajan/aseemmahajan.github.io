I draw on game-theoretic models, experiments, surveys, and panel methods to research a variety of topics in environmental politics, including climate resilience, rural electrification, climate equity, and solar geoengineering. As climate change increases the anticipated frequency and intensity of severe weather events, communities must invest in building climate resilience. What political and economic factors determine whether, when and how municipalities adapt and who they seek to protect? To what extent do private interests influence their decisions, and how? My dissertation project explores these questions in the context of the State of Massachusetts's Municipal Vulnerability Preparedness (MVP) grant program. My other research examines how actors perceive equity in the context of negotiations around greenhouse gas mitigation, public opinion toward solar geoengineering and institutional constraints on counter-geoengineering, the effects of electrification and lighting in rural India, and social choice theory. 

Previously, I worked at [IFF](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aseemmahajan?trk=nav_responsive_tab_profile), a Community Development Financial Institution in Chicago; and at PricewaterhouseCoopers' Global Transfer Pricing division in New York. I graduated from Princeton University in 2009 where I concentrated in politics and earned certificates in finance and political economy.
